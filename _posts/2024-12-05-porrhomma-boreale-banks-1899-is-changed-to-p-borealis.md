[_Porrhomma boreale_ (Banks, 1899)](https://wsc.nmbe.ch/species/17349) was made available as _Gongylidium borealis_, Banks 1899. _Borealis_ is only an adjective in Classical Latin, but it was substantivized as a noun in Medieval Latin, according to the [Mittellateinisches Wörterbuch](https://mlat.uzh.ch/dictionaries). The ICZN notes in the [Glossary](https://code.iczn.org/formation-and-treatment-of-names/article-30-gender-of-genus-group-names?frame=1) that Latin "includes both ancient and mediaeval Latin". Verrill did not make any statement indicating that _borealis_ was to be considered as an adjective or a noun, nor that it was derived from a non-Latin or non-Greek word. According to ICZN 31.2.2, the species name must be considered as a noun in apposition to the genus, and the original spelling is to be retained.

_Porrhomma borealis_ (Banks, 1899) is the correct name.
